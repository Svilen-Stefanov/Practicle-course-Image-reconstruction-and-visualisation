1. What interesting and unexpected situations did you encounter during your tests?

- The first interesting thing for me was the order of creation of the constructors, because
I wasn't sure whether the global or the member constructor will be created at first.

- I wasn't also sure where exactly the global and the member destructors will be called,
but as I supposed, they were deleted at the end of the program.

- During the implementation I have firstly also forgotten that I should create a default
constructor in order to test the copy constructor.

- It was also interesting to see how exceptions influence the deconstruction of an object.
If a deletion of an object is attempted in a try block after an exception is thrown, the
object won't be deleted, which might lead to memory leaks in larger programs, when more objects
are allocated on the heap.
