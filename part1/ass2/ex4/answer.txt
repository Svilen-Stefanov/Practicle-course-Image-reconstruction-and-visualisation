1. Why would people want to use such a Rational class?
The already implemented class double tries to calculate the value of the rational number and round it.
The result is an approximation of this rational number in the form of X.Y, where X and Y are dot-separated integers.
Furthermore, double uses a binary representation for the rational number. Since some rational numbers have an infinite representation in binary,
but the computer memory is limited, you can lose some precision because of rounding.

For some scientific projects, one might need the exact value of a calculation, and not its approximation.
That is why you may need this class, where the exact value is stored as an object of 2 integers.
The overloading of the arithmetic operations makes it possible to be more precise when counting with these rational numbers.
What is more, the overloaded double operator makes the class convenient for cases, where you want to convert it to the already
existing double type.
