1.What are the design issues of the previous exercise?
The problem with the previous implementation of NamePairs (in exercise 2) is
that the two vectors for Names and for Ages are not connected to each other.

Thus, it could happen that the two vectors are of different sizes. If that is
the case, a synonymous match can't be done for Names and Ages.
Therefore methods on such not equally sized vectors won't be able to match pairs properly.
Furthermore, it doesn't make sense to be able to insert more Ages than Names
or vice versa.

From the programmers' point of view this will lead to additional exception
handling, in order to ensure that this vectors have the same size.

2. What can you do to address those issues?
In order to connect the Names and Ages, I chose a multimap to insert a key-value pair,
where name is the key and age is its value. Thus it can be guaranteed that every key has a value.
Furthermore, one doesn't need a sorting method any more, because the class multimap
sorts automatically its elements (in this case by the alphabetical order of its keys).
